# WebBrowser automation for hardcoded scenario

Sometimes we need to conduct a scenario using webautomated browser. Actually when we have defined input and output of operationa, then challlenge is to automate web browser to obtain result values.

I would like to avoid using Selenium because it is error prone (according to my experience), but rather using [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp) which should be async and fast.
